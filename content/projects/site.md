# The Background



- started with github pages 
- add custom domain
- move domain from route 53 to cloudflare
    - cloudflared is tempting
- saw cloudflare has their own setup
- want dev + prod sites
originall did github & cloudflare, too many different workflows
- new repo, rename (drop .github.io) -- mention -github-io.pages.dev
      - rename before any of this!

- brief explanation of dev workflow folder -- was very cool
- show setup in cloudflare
- dns nonsense
- removing github pages
- cloudflare application access for development site (bonus!)
